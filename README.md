Predicting Campus Placement Outcomes Using Machine Learning

Campus placements play a vital role in shaping students' career paths, acting as a bridge between academic learning and professional opportunities. A student's ability to secure employment depends on multiple factors, including academic achievements, technical skills, soft skills, and hands-on experience. As job market competition grows, both students and educational institutions are increasingly turning to data-driven strategies to boost placement success rates.

Machine learning (ML) has proven to be an effective approach for predictive analysis across various fields, including education and job forecasting. This study applies ML techniques to predict students' placement outcomes based on a dataset that includes academic records, internship experience, certifications, and extracurricular participation. Initially, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was chosen due to its strong classification ability, particularly when handling high-dimensional data. However, since SVM is prone to overfitting and requires high computational power, a Random Forest Classifier was introduced to enhance model accuracy, interpretability, and generalization.

This report compares the two models, analyzing their predictive accuracy, overfitting risks, and real-world applicability. The research involves data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, performance assessment, and visualization to extract meaningful insights. By utilizing machine learning, this study aims to help institutions refine their placement strategies and better equip students for job opportunities.
